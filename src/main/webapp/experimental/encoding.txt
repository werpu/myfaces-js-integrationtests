encoding issues:
a) all browsers except ie and opera ignore an encoding passed down in the request header

b) jsf determines the content type upon the first request and then stores it in the session
it therefore ignores the encoding pushed down by the ajax request

so theoretically b kills a as bug

Next problem
on the javascript side we cannot use encodeURIComponent which works only on UTF-8 properly

encodeUriComponent:
Encodes a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)
component by replacing each instance of certain characters by one,
two, or three escape sequences representing the UTF-8 encoding of the character.

So we get here escape sequences which are utf based. So an internal conversion from
iso to unicode is performend here, which then the server should restore back to iso.
