        <h2>response only handling</h2>

        <p>
            This is a regression test for
            <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYFACES-3401">MYFACES-3401</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            This test tests for certain corner conditions
            regarding the context, practically
            a response call with context:{source:{}} as only
            param must go through the codebase
            theoretically due to a richfaces 4.0 bug
            a response of context:{} also must process
            by simply processing the response
            but ignoring the viewstate (undocumented corner
            case which probably later can be dropped)
        </p>

        <script type="text/javascript">
            var oldResponse = jsf.ajax.response;
            //we are going to decorate the response for the first testcase
            (function() {

                var newResponse = function(request, context) {
                    var newContext = {};
                    newContext.source = context.source;
                    oldResponse(request, newContext);
                }
                jsf.ajax.response = newResponse;
            })();
