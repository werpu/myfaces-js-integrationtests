As of version 2.1.4 myfaces allows modular jsf.js includes to reduce the overall filesizes according to your
browsers demands.

Following modes are available under the web.xml context parameter:
 org.apache.myfaces.JSF_JS_MODE


 * normal all submodules included into a separate bundle
 * minimal ... all features for modern and legacy browsers excluding experimental features and i18n support
 * minimal-modern ... all base features and the code is stripped of legacy browser support,
 the latest stable browsers are the baseline for this mode (IE9, Firefox 8, etc...), this baseline is a moving
 target and code will be further reduced according to the latest stable browsers capabilities.

 If you work with minimal or minimal-modern and need to add some of the features of normal on a per usage base you
 can to it via following includes:
 library file
 myfaces  jsf-experimental.js experimental features
 myfaces  jsf-i18n.js  i18n bundles for additional languages for the client side error messages
 myfaces  jsf-legacy.js legacy browser support


the include can be performed following way
